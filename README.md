# Introduction
Following the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research directives regarding the implementation of Ministerial Resolution 1275, which includes a diploma-a start-up / a diploma-a patent with the
aim to create a generation of entrepreneurial students who have the ability and desire to go towards innovative entrepreneurship and build startups that create wealth and job positions, and to find a technical,
technological and digital solution for existing problems.
We at DEVCORE, a team of elite students from the Higher school of computer science engineering 8
May 1945 ESI-SBA, are developing a web platform and a mobile application under the name StartEase
with the goal of automating and simplifying the projects submission operation.

# StartEase

StartEase is a service that allows students to team up and submit their start-up ideas for approval by
the scientific committee. During the process, supervisors will be assigned to each team, Once the idea
is approved, supervisors have to duty to oversee the development process and provide guidance till the
defence. The platform will be accessible through both web and mobile interfaces and will be designed to
meet the needs of students, mentors, and juries involved in the process. The platform will also include
appropriate security measures to ensure the safety and confidentiality of user data. The project will not
involve the development of any physical products or services beyond the online platform.

## Architecture

The mobile application is built using the Flutter framework, which is a Google-developed open-source
mobile app SDK for building high-performance, high-fidelity, apps for iOS and Android, from a single
codebase. The app is integrated with GetX, a popular state management library that allows for reactive
and asynchronous programming.
