# StartEase

StartEase is a service that allows students to team up and submit their start-up ideas for approval by
the scientific committee. During the process, supervisors will be assigned to each team, Once the idea
is approved, supervisors have to duty to oversee the development process and provide guidance till the
defence. The platform will be accessible through both web and mobile interfaces and will be designed to
meet the needs of students, mentors, and juries involved in the process. The platform will also include
appropriate security measures to ensure the safety and confidentiality of user data. The project will not
involve the development of any physical products or services beyond the online platform.

## Architecture

The mobile application is built using the Flutter framework, which is a Google-developed open-source
mobile app SDK for building high-performance, high-fidelity, apps for iOS and Android, from a single
codebase. The app is integrated with GetX, a popular state management library, an extra-light and powerful solution for Flutter. It combines high-performance state management, intelligent dependency injection, and route management quickly and practically.
- ✅ Multi-Language: English, French.
